# Wikipedia-Donation-Remover

The purpose of this fork is to remove all ideological swaying in either direction regarding the financial decisions of Wikipedia's users. 

This code is forked from [Wikipedia-Donation-Destroyer](https://github.com/BryanLunduke/Wikipedia-Donation-Destroyer) by `BryanLunduke`.

This project also removes undocumented behavior from the original project, as they intend to sway users donation behavior based on non-merit based information.

## Philosophy

This project thinks both donation banners and revene statements are not good reasons to donate or not donate to any given project or service. Instead, users should donate based on the merit and utility of the project/service they intend to make a decision about.

## Download

This extension is made avalible on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikipedia-donation-remover/) with Chrome Webstore support coming later. Both Chrome and Firefox are supported by the code.
