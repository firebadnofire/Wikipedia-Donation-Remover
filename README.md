# Wikipedia-Donation-Destroyer

This is a simple Google Chrome Extension which does two things (and two things only)

1. Blocks the Wikipedia "Donate or Wikipedia will die in 3 minutes!" popups.
2. Displays the true financials of Wikipedia in a small, closable box.

The Wikipedia Donation Destroyer will also display financial data for Mozilla, if you are on their website.  Just for good measure.

The code is simple.  No data is collected.  No trackers or advertisements.

You're welcome.
